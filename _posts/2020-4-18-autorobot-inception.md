As I’ve been thinking about what to do next, I realized I wanted to do a larger-scale project that pushes the limits of what I can do. Rather than focus on trying to do something novel, I’m going to focus on doing something difficult but valuable. The idea is simple: a small autonomous robot, resilient and versatile. The goals for the robot, in general order of importance, are:

* Autonomous obstacle detection and avoidance
* Real-time status reports, including video
* Manual override control
* Ability to navigate semi-rough terrain
* Path planning

Obviously, this kind of robot has been built before by others, and it’s not mechanically complicated. The purpose of this project is to develop other essential skills, such as electrical design and programming, while I’m away from a place where I can attempt complicated mechanical experiments. Hopefully, this will give me a base skill set that other, more complicated projects will be able to draw on.

The timeline of this project is pretty uncertain, especially given the chaos of third term. I’m gonna work on it when I have time, and post about it here (edit: things got a little busy and I didn't. Look for a note on the projects page soon).
