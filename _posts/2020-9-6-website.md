Today I launch my new website (the one you're on). I've wanted to have a nice website for a while now, and the 5-week break between the end of SURF and the start of term ended up being a great time to work on it. This website is based off two templates (one for the main site, and one for the project pages), and its source code is publicly available on [GitHub](https://github.com/lopenguin/lopenguin.github.io).

Even though the site is based off these templates, I've spent a considerable amount of time changing things to my liking. It's written using the Jekyll framework and published through GitHub Pages, which also offered me a free domain name as part of the Student Developer Pack.

I'm not much of a blogger, so don't expect this blog to be updated often. It's gonna be more of a space to try out ideas (at least put them into writing before actually trying to go through with them). There's no real formal format I'm gonna follow either. This site is mostly just a fun project that allows me to showcase a little of my experience. I hope you find it interesting.
