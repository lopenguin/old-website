With the added time of spring break and online classes, I finally have time to build some robots! I wanted to try something unique, fun, and germane to my SURF project, so I decided to build some sort of bipedal robot. The basic idea is to create something simple that can move on two legs. Here’s a brief description of what I came up with:

A robot with two long (8 inches, to be precise) legs attached to an elevated platform at the top of the legs. The platform contains two motors that move the legs separately in complete circles (yes, it’s a little ridiculous). They’ll move slowly when the leg is on the ground and more quickly when it is off the ground, making sure one leg is always on the ground. In this way, the robot “hops” between two legs.

With this basic idea, I’m now evaluating what parts will be necessary and what high-level design changes need to be made. After these decisions are complete, I’ll draw up a Solidworks model and post some screenshots.
