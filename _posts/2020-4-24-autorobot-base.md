The AutoRobot (yes, that’s what I’m calling it now) has a body! As promised, it’s a very simple mechanical design with four powered wheels attached to a single foam base. I opted for four wheels instead of two because of the increased range of motion; whatever algorithm ends up being developed will need to account for the different characteristics of the two sets of wheels. This setup takes the place of a third front passive front wheel or ball, providing more clearance.

The other design choice I made was to put the motors on the bottom of the chassis. This frees up space on top for electronics and sensors, and it increases ground clearance. One compromise (for simplicity) was that the robot is no longer going to be waterproof. That’s just not worth incorporating at this stage, but it may find its way into future robots based on this one.

As a reminder, the goal of this project is to use the simple mechanical design to develop an electronics package and set of control algorithms that can be applied to a more complicated robot in the future. Since I don’t have access to machines or 3D printers, the mechanical design is very limited by the materials available. I didn’t bother putting this design into Solidworks because it is so simple.
