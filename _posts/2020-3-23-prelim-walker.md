Today I finalized the preliminary design for the walking robot I’m working on. It’s focused on simplicity: two legs and a motor mount between them are all it has. The Arduino and power supplies will sit above and below the motor mount platform, and weight on that platform will have to be carefully calibrated to ensure the robot can balance.

A couple issues that are starting to come up: mounting and motion. Mounting the components is going to be difficult without glue, especially because I’m away from the 3D printing lab at Caltech. Weight distribution is going to be a critical part of this, so I want it to be able to move. I’ll probably start with tape or some form of Velcro and move on to dedicated mounting surfaces once the project reaches that stage.

Motion is the other (obvious) problem. The way I originally planned for this thing to move is going to be pretty intense and unstable. Full motion of the legs will also restrict the expansion of the prototype. For now, I’m going to stick with this plan just because I think it is a cool idea, but I’m exploring other options.

One such option is to have the body remain parallel to the ground and move the legs within a 30 degree angle. This would allow a more traditional style of walking, but requires different actuators. If the first movement method is a catastrophic failure, I’ll switch. I may save this type of motion for a future project.

Next steps: start building. My goal is get a moving prototype done soon!
