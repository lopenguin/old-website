This busy summer is coming to a close. I've spent it at home in quarantine, but there was some fun along the way. I worked on my [SURF project](/projects/ankle-exo) throughout the summer, and in my free time I learned C++ and built an [autonomous car](/projects/autocar). Now that term's about to start up again, I'm left largely without a project as things start to get really busy.

I'll still be working on my SURF project, and I've been doing robotics and PARSEC (Caltech rocketry), but I want to do something of my own. If you've seen the tag of this you might have an idea of what's next: a second walker. This time I have a 3D printer, template code, and a better battery. I'm going to try to build a similar two-legged walker (actually two legs this time). How will it remain stable? It probably won't, but I will try to make sure it does by putting an inverted pendulum controlled by a servo on top. This should be able to dampen any forward/backward instability, and will be a fun controls problem.

We'll see if I can do it.
