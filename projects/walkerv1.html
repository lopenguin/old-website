            The goal of this project was to build a robot that could move on two legs in the simplest manner possible. The final design consists of the two legs attached to motors on a shared platform with a third leg added behind for stabilization. The electronics, stored inside of the platform, include an Arduino, power supply, and h-bridge motor driver. With this setup, the Walker was able to move forward slowly under an external power supply. The motors were not strong enough to move the robot under its own supply.
