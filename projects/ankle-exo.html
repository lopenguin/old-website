            Powered ankle exoskeletons can enhance the human ability to carry load, improve metabolic efficiency, and assist in rehabilitative tasks for injured patients. Ankle exoskeletons also serve as a useful platform for more complex control algorithms since they only have one degree of actuation. Control algorithms used on the ankle exoskeleton can then be extended to full lower-body exoskeletons with 12 degrees of actuation. Thus, we designed an autonomous ankle exoskeleton to reduce the metabolic cost of walking and provide a one-degree-of-freedom platform for controls testing. The lightweight device actuates two moment arms attached to the foot to generate a mechanical torque during the transition from stance to swing in the walking gait. With its modular design, electronics can be concentrated at the waist to maximize efficiency or at the shin to minimize complexity. Basic control simulations and calculations show the exoskeleton can apply torques comparable to normal biological torque, making use of a sleek angled strut design to redirect forces and maximize user comfort. Once constructed, this device will provide a platform for complex controls to optimize its own function and aid in the development of larger exoskeletons.
