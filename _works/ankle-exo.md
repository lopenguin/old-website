## Development of a Powered Ankle Exoskeleton
This was SURF project over the summer in 2020. I worked with Toussaint Pegues, another undergrad, and Maegan Tucker, a grad student in the AMBER Lab on developing an ankle exoskeleton for controls testing. I worked on the mechanical design, focusing on struts and the motor mount. I also designed a power supply PCB and ran controls simulations through OpenSim and MATLAB. At the end of the 10-week project I decided to stay on and have continued working.
