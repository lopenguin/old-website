## Project Overview
EE/ME 7 is a freshmen lab class focused on mechatronics. Over the quarter we worked on 13 labs that explored various parts of a mechatronic system in depth, including motors, sensors, gears, and many other parts. The final project was to design and build a small car with a partner that moved in the direction of an ultrasonic pulse using only op-amps and transistors. Our car was designed to allow switching between bang-bang and PI control, although only the bang-bang version was ultimately tested.
