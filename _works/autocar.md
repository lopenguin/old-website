## Project Overview
This was primarily a exploratory project. Mechanically, it utilizes the old four-wheel car design, without any mechanism to steer by moving an axle and just having the motors connect directly to the wheels. It's a product of the limitations of the current time--I'm not on campus, so I don't have access to resources like a 3D printer, laser cutter, or machine shop. Instead, this project focused on the electrical and programming sides of any mechatronic system. By making these systems complex and aiming for autonomous movement, I've created a set of template code for use in future, more mechanically complicated projects.
